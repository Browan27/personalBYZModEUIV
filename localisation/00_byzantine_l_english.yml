 begin_roman_rivalry_title: "Challenge the HRE's Claims"
 begin_roman_rivalry_desc: "For centuries now, from Charlemagne until the present day, the foolish Franks and Nemitzoi have claimed the title of 'Roman emperors'. Though this claim is manifestly preposterous, many Latin nations have gone along with them. Now we are in a position to make a forceful case that we really are the Roman Empire, and we should try to convince whomever will listen of this fact. The Frankish emperor will not be pleased, of course."
 
 roman_rivalry.EVTNAME1: "Imperial Friction!"
 roman_rivalry.EVTDESC1: "As our diplomats have been travelling about Europe pointing out the illegitimacy of the Nemitzoi claims to be the 'Holy Roman Empire' and asserting that we are the real Romans of the day, some of the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassadors have become upset. The Holy Roman Emperor has heard of our claims, and is by all accounts most displeased. An envoy has reached our court and announced that if we do not desist from impugning the 'emperor's' dignity then hostilities may well follow."
 roman_rivalry.EVTOPTA1: "If that is the price to pay for the truth, then so be it."
 roman_rivalry.EVTOPTB1: "We do not actually want war with the Nemitzoi right now."
 
 roman_rivalry.EVTNAME2: "Imperial Hostilities"
 roman_rivalry.EVTDESC2: "With our ambassadors continuing their diplomatic offensive, asserting our rightful status as Roman emperors, we hear that the 'Holy Roman' ruler has become enraged. It seems that the Nemitzoi have been severely embarrassed by the obvious legitimacy of our claims to Roman heritage. Fearing for their position among the Latins, they openly threaten us with the prospect of war if we do not keep our claims to ourselves. Choosing to press ahead with the conflict will lead to a period of open confrontation with the HRE in which war is a likelihood and there can only be one winner."
 roman_rivalry.EVTOPTA2: "We shall show you true Roman steel."
 roman_rivalry.EVTOPTB2: "Discretion is the better part of valour."
 
 roman_rivalry.EVTNAME3: "The Rightful Roman Emperor!"
 roman_rivalry.EVTDESC3: "My Emperor! Through courageous struggle and manly hardship, we have laid the 'Holy Roman Emperor' low!

 roman_rivalry.EVTOPTA3: "Let us take up the mantle for these Germans."
 roman_rivalry.EVTOPTB3: "Neither Holy nor Roman, and now not an Empire."
 
 roman_rivalry.EVTNAME4: "A Temporary Defeat!"
 roman_rivalry.EVTDESC4: "My Emperor! The perfidious Nemitzoi have managed to force us to withdraw our claims to Roman imperial dignity. Nonetheless, it is only a temporary setback; when they are weak, we shall strike again and prove that we should be the legitimate rulers of the world."
 roman_rivalry.EVTOPTA4: "This isn't over."

 byz_events_per.1.t: "The Purple Phoenix"
 byz_events_per.1.d: "The last few decades have been long and hard. Our once glorious empire has been reduced to our quaint greek holdings and the few governances that are still loyal to us. The ottoman turks have taken much of our anatolian land thanks to our weakened state after the semi-successful attack on constantinople by Venice long ago. However, we find ourselves under a new Basileus, and with his guidance, we can drive our Mahomedan oppressors back from whence they came, wreak vengeance against the schismists who dared to attack us, reclaim our ancient western holdings and rekindle our old empire!"
 byz_events_per.1.a: "Roma Invicta!"
 
 byz_events_per.2.t: "Victory in Anatolia"
 byz_events_per.2.d: "With strokes of blade and pen we have vanquished our turkish aggressors. The lands of Anatolia are now safeguarded by proper Roman rule once again. The question remains of the citizens. Few follow the faith, and even fewer can claim to be Greek. Already there are groups willing to resettle Anatolia, while others advocate a peaceful reintegration. How should we procede?"
 byz_events_per.2.a: "Resettle Greek lands and Integrate the Turks"
 byz_events_per.2.b: "Purge the heathans!"
